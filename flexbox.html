                <p>Russian is the most widely spoken of the Slavic languages and also the most intense and strong language in my opinion. It uses the Cyrillic alphabet and is known for its complex grammar, including a case system and verb aspects. Russian has significant global influence and cultural impact, as my awareness of it came from movies, especially ones about the Russian mob and its Oligarchs. Additionally, Russian literature, with renowned authors like Tolstoy and Dostoevsky, has made substantial contributions to world culture.</p>
